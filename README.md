# OpenMRC: Open Source MISRA-C Rule Checker based on Eclipse CDT(C/C++ Development Tooling)
note: This is a cloned project from suntae kim's OpenMRC
OpenMRC is an open source MISRA (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association)-C rule checker, developed as an Eclipse CDT plugin. 
The following is an overall steps to use OpenMRC.

OpenMRC has a two-step usage:
- At the first step, OpenMRC obtains the C source code for Vehicle software, and then it builds the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) by using the C-AST parser bundled in Eclipse CDT.
- At the second step, OpenMRC traverses all of the AST elements in order to check violations of MISRA-C: 2004 Guideline Rules, and produces violation messages. The messages are shown in the Eclipse CDT views (see the TableViewer page below).

Based on the violation messages, a vehicle software developer continuously updates their source to achieve the vehicle software's functional safety. 

## TableViewer for Showing Violation Messages
- In TableViewer, OpenMRC shows which rules has been violated in the C source code. When the developer selects one of the violation messages in the viewer, OpenMRC automatically hightlights the violated part in the code as shown in the figure below:

## Preference Setting for (De)Selecting MISRA-C Rules
- OpenMRC provides the Preference page that can selectively check the MISRA-C Rules. In the Preference page, all rules are categorized and a developer can select/deselect the rules.
